OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT : bjective: Blink an LED connected to an Arduino board at a specific interval
KEY ACTIVITIES : 
Setup and Initialization

 . Selecting Components: Choose an Arduino board (such as Arduino Uno), an LED, a current-limiting resistor (typically 220 ohms), and necessary connecting wires.
 . Connecting the LED: Wire the longer leg (anode) of the LED to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 13). Connect the shorter leg (cathode) to ground (GND) via the resistor to prevent excessive current flow.
 TECHONOLOGIES USED :
. Arduino Uno (or any compatible board)
. Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
. C/C++ programming language
. Basic electronic components (LED, resistor, wires)
